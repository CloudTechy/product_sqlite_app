## General info
This project is actually a flutter mobile app that literally displays the list of products stored in a sqlite database.
The motivation behind this app is to reveal how to effectively communicate with the SQLite databases in Flutter apps.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view @flutter
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Flutter 1.9.1+hotfix.6
  * Dart 2.5.0
  * ###### IDE Applicable
        * Android Studio (recommended)
        * Visual Studio Code

## Scope
At the moment the scope of this project is currently limited to displaying products from the SQlite database.
 Adding, deleting, editing of a product in the SQlite database is yet to be incorporated in the UI,
  but the database capabilities  is already done.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using pub:


**Flutter note: If you're using the Flutter SDK, don't use the pub command directly**

```bash
$ cd ../product_sqlite_app
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter run
```

_It is recommended you run_
 ```bash
 $ flutter doctor
 ```
_to make sure you get all the project environment right, it will need to output_
  ```bash
  "No issues found"
  ```
